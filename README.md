# IIgs-Play
A place for small toy code on the Apple IIgs computer.


This is where I will be putting little projects for the Apple IIgs computer. 
Some will be GS/OS based, others will be BareMetal.
Just toys and simple utilities that I may write from time to time.
May be of use as sample code to some, who knows.

All code here is released under the MIT license, so feel free to use it if you find it useful.


Sorry for this being a bit on the slow side.  Have not been doing much with any computers lately.

Finaly might actually get something in this repo before too long.   I had been to focused on other things, that are not as worthy.  Now I am getting back into IIgs, Amiga, and Macintosh mode where I should have stayed.
