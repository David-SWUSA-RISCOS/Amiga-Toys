# IIgs-Play
A place for small toy code on the Apple IIgs computer.


This is where I will be putting little projects for the Apple IIgs computer. 
Some will be GS/OS based, others will be BareMetal.
Just toys and simple utilities that I may write from time to time.
May be of use as sample code to some, who knows.

All code here is released under the MIT license, so feel free to use it if you find it useful.
