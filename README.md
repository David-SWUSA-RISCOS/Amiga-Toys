# Amiga Play


Time to be realistic.  Yes I still play on the Apple IIgs, thoguh I play a lot more on the Amiga and actually have code that can be shared for the Amiga a lot more often than for the IIgs.  As such this Repo has changed names and targets to the Amiga.

Much of this content will be in Amiga BASIC as extended in the ACE compiler.  It will be rare to use any extensions, and many porgrams will run in traditional Amiga BASIC.

Other things will be in C and 680x0 assembly language.  I try to be sure that programs will run on Amiga OS 3, though I primarily use Amiga OS 1.3 on an Amiga 3000.

As some of my RISC OS programs are ports of my Amiga programs so the opisite is true.  That is some of my Amiga programs are ports of my RISC OS programs.

Much of this will end up with a YASDOE native port someday.

Despite what many think, AmigaBASIC and BBC BASIC V are very much modern complete programming languages that given a good compiler are able to do all things that any other procedural language can (as well as OO [yes it can, just think BOOPSI in C also applies to BASIC]).  While these are two quite different versions of BASIC they are equaly capable as modern programming languages.
