# IIgs-Play
A place for small toy code on the Apple IIgs computer.


This is where I will be putting little projects for the Apple IIgs computer. 
Some will be GS/OS based, others will be BareMetal.
Just things to have some fun with the great computer.
May be of use as sample code to some, who knows.

All code here is released under the MIT license, so feel free to use it if you find it useful.

I will be slowly expanding on the [github WiKi for this repository](https://github.com/David-SWUSA-RISCOS/IIgs-Play/wiki) , with the intent of having fun, and providing some simple documentation that may be of use to other IIgs users.


Sorry for this being a bit on the slow side.  Have not been doing much with any computers lately.

Finaly might actually get something in this repo before too long.   I had been to focused on other things, that are not as worthy.  Now I am getting back into IIgs, Amiga, and Macintosh mode where I should have stayed.
